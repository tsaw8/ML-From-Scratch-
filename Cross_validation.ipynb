    "# Implement Resampling Methods From Scratch in Python\n",

    "## Description \n",
    "The goal of resampling methods is to make the best use of your training data in order to accurately estimate the performance of a model on new unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accurate estimates of performance can then be used to help you choose which set of model parameters to use or which model to select.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have chosen a model, you can train for final model on the entire training dataset and start using it to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common resampling methods that you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A train and test split of your data.\n",
    "* k-fold cross validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will implement both resampling methods from scatch. [Source](https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-resampling-methods-scratch-python/)"
